# CodeIsLife100days

I'm committed to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days to significantly improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This repository will document my journey and host the projects I build in the process. 

**My main goals are to:**

✔️ Become proficient with HTML5 semantic markup and accessibility

✔️ Master CSS layouts including Flexbox and Grid 

✔️ Learn responsive web design principles 

✔️ Improve JavaScript skills by building interactive interfaces

✔️ Experiment with animations, visualizations, and web APIs

✔️ Push myself out of my comfort zone with new techniques

**What I'll be posting:**

🔹 Daily updates tracking my progress 

🔹 Code samples and mini-projects 

🔹 Helpful resources for learning web development

🔹 Demo hosted links to finished websites & apps

🔹 Lessons learned and takeaways from the challenge

Let the 100 days of code begin! Open to any feedback or ideas for mini coding projects. 

Thanks for checking it out!
